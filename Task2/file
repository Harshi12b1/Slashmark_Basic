# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
=====================================

**Project Summary**
-------------------

A data analystâ€™s job would be incomplete without EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). An EDA analyses the structure of data, allowing you to identify patterns and characteristics. Furthermore, they assist you in cleaning data, extracting important variables, identifying anomalies, and testing your underlying assumptions often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

**Project Overview**
-------------------

This project aims to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on a given dataset to uncover its underlying structure, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. The project will utilize various statistical and visualization techniques to analyze the data, identify anomalies, and validate assumptions.

**Dataset**
------------

* [Insert dataset name and description, e.g. "Iris Dataset" or "COVID-19 Cases Dataset"]
* [Insert dataset source, e.g. "UCI Machine Learning Repository" or "Kaggle"]

**Objectives**
-------------

* Analyze the structure of the dataset
* Identify patterns and relationships between variables
* Extract important variables and features
* Identify anomalies and outliers
* Validate underlying assumptions using statistical graphics and visualization methods

**Techniques Used**
-------------------

* Descriptive statistics
* Data visualization (e.g. histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
* Correlation analysis
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Clustering analysis
* Anomaly detection

**Tools and Technologies**
-------------------------

*  e.g. Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
